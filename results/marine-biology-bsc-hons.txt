courseName: MARINE-BIOLOGY-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Sea levels are rising. Icebergs are melting. Species are facing extinction. Now more than ever, we need to protect our precious marine resources. That’s where you come in…


When you choose Hull, you’re at the centre of one of the UK’s most important aquatic habitats. The North Sea, internationally recognised research facilities – including The Deep – and the rest of the Yorkshire Nature Triangle are on your doorstep.


Fieldwork opportunities here are exceptional – both at home and overseas. Recently, our students got the chance to work in far-flung places like Brazil and Egypt. On top of this, we offer part-funded PADI advanced scuba dive training as part of your degree.


Plus, this course is accredited by The Institution of Environmental Sciences (IES). So when you graduate, you have a clear pathway to become a Chartered Environmentalist or Chartered Scientist.


And then there’s the researchers, academics and technicians who’ll be teaching you…


You learn from the best: a small, friendly department that does world-leading research.

moduleName Marine Biology: An Introduction
moduleName Marine Biology: An Introduction
moduleName From space, the planet is blue. Marine life has evolved into a myriad of forms living in some of the most extreme habitats on the planet; from great depths to battered coasts. This introduction to marine biology explores the marine environment, the diversity of life within it and how to conserve it.

moduleName Ecology (with optional Dive Training)
moduleName Ecology (with optional Dive Training)
moduleName Ecology is the study of interactions among living organisms and their environment, and is the basis for nature conservation and understanding human impact on the planet. Gain an understanding of ecological theory, applied ecology, and the collection and analysis of ecological data. You can choose to complete integrated PADI Advanced Open Water training, with an opportunity to develop specialist diving skills relevant to ecological science.

moduleName Vertebrate Zoology
moduleName Vertebrate Zoology
moduleName This module provides an integrated view of vertebrate biology by showing how changes over time and geography drive morphology, physiology, behaviour, and ecology in different vertebrates. Structure-function relationships are presented to appreciate how different animals evolve similar solutions and adaptations to the same ecological challenge while closely-related animals diversify in response to different environmental challenges.

moduleName Molecular Evolution and Genomics
moduleName Molecular Evolution and Genomics
moduleName This module will focus on the big topics in molecular evolution. What do genomes contain and why? How do we build trees from DNA sequences? How can recombination or gene duplication or transposons lead to adaptation? How do we detect selection in the human genome? We’ll cover these in theory and in practice with some fascinating examples from nature.
