courseName: PHYSICS-WITH-ASTROPHYSICS-BSC-MPHYS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Physics with Astrophysics encourages you to delve into the make-up of the universe: exploring topics from planets in our solar system to distant galaxies and abstract phenomena, as you study with experts.


The University’s expertise was recognised as far back as 1969 when we were one of the scientific centres chosen to carry out tests on samples gathered from the Moon by Neil Armstrong’s historic Apollo 11 mission.


We'll give you the theoretical and practical tools to reveal and understand the underlying laws that govern the universe – from the smallest sub-atomic particle to the grand scale of cosmology.

Substantial discounts are available for International students.  
More information on fees can be found in the Money section of our website. 
Your tuition fees will cover most costs associated with your programme (including registration, tuition, supervision, assessment and examination).There are some extra costs that you might have to pay, or choose to pay, depending on your programme of study and the decisions you make. The list below has some examples, and any extra costs will vary.

Books (you’ll have access to books from your module reading lists in the library, but you may want to buy your own copies)
Optional field trips
Study abroad (including travel costs, accommodation, visas, immunisation)
Placement costs (including travel costs and accommodation)
Student visas (international students)
Laptop (you’ll have access to laptops and PC’s on campus, but you may want to buy your own)
