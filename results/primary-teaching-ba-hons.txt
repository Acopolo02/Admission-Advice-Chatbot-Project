COURSE OVERVIEW

This is your chance to make a real difference to the next generation of thinkers, makers and dreamers.


Here, you’ll be shaping the lives of children and young people: developing theory from experienced education practitioners. And, crucially, you’ll be putting it into practice in the classroom.


We offer routes to Qualified Teacher Status either through the Primary Teaching degree or our top-up course. Our courses give you the opportunity to specialise in a core subject of Maths, English or Science, using dynamic pedagogical methods taught by expert staff whose research spans a variety of educational areas.


With us, you’ll get individual tutor support, a school-based mentor for your placements, a University tutor and a pedagogical specialist. We have guest lectures and visits from members of the local educational community – providing up-to-date perspectives on education – as well as opportunities to develop a background in special educational needs. We’ve got links with a range of educational institutions across the UK, in cities and in the country.


This means that our courses all come with fantastic opportunities to put your learning into practice – giving you the kind of practical experience that future employers value.
