courseName: LAW-AND-LEGISLATIVE-STUDIES-LLB-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

This is a specialised and unique programme with a 12-month placement in Westminster where you'll work for a Member of Parliament or a peer, giving you in-depth exposure to British parliamentary procedures and behaviours.


As a hands-on law degree offering you an in-depth understanding of law and the political system, you'll learn to think like a lawyer, and apply your knowledge of legal and political science to social problems and challenges.


You get lots of opportunities to apply your thinking to the real-world, such as having the chance to provide real legal advice to real clients at our Legal Advice Centre and our recently enhanced Mediation Centre - meaning you could be helping parents regain contact with their children, advising clients on divorce and property rights, and assisting with appeals against benefits decisions. 


Hone your debating skills in our authentic mock courtrooms. Our new state-of-the-art criminal court allows you to bring the courtroom to life right here on campus. Practice your skills in mock trials and prepare for your future career. Our Student Law Society organises regular mooting competitions, as well as client interview practice.


Our links with the sector offer you the chance to take part in internships with local law firms and government, and mini-pupillages with Wilberforce Chambers.
