courseName: CRIMINOLOGY-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Hull pioneered the exciting study of criminology more than 40 years ago and has led the way as one of the UK’s leading centres in this area.


In that time, we've formed close links with the police and other criminal justice agencies, meaning that our degrees stay up-to-date, practical and relevant. It also means you'll get amazing placement opportunities and field trips to courts, police stations and prisons.


Put what you learn into practice in our purpose-built replica crime scene facility right here on campus. A recent addition to the university, it provides detailed and realistic crime scenes for you to explore. Get hands-on: collect evidence, explore criminal activity and see the world of forensic science brought to life.


When you choose one of our Criminology degrees, you’ll get the chance to apply for a semester-long placement with Humberside Police**. You’ll work with areas like CSI, the Special Branch Ports Unit, community policing, cyber crime and the custody suite. And you’ll visit crime scenes, observe interviews and collect evidence.


It also means you'll get a range of amazing opportunities to explore criminology in real-life situations, such as through placements, field trips to courts, and police stations and prisons. Recent students have also had the opportunity to investigate policing and security issues.


You can also expand your skills and experience through a range of rewarding volunteering opportunities - such as the Appropriate Adult scheme.


As well as our annual Careers in Criminal Justice event, which allows our students to hear from, and network with employers from the sector, you will learn from lecturers who are experts in their own relevant areas – from modern-day slavery to knife crime; from domestic violence to cyber terrorism. They bring their specialist knowledge into the lecture theatre and help you define and develop your own areas of interest.
