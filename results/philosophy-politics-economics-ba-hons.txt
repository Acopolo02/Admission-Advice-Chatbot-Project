courseName: PHILOSOPHY-POLITICS-ECONOMICS-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

PPE degrees have produced political leaders, thinkers and commentators – from David Cameron to Christopher Hitchens to Robert Peston. 


Hull’s version is one of the best established, with the chance to be selected for a placement in Westminster. Take on the challenge of this classic combined programme to gain a wider perspective on modern society.


This is one of the longest-running courses of its kind in the country and a flagship programme for the University. It attracts some of our highest-calibre students, many of whom go on to a political career.


We'll train you not merely to absorb information but to engage, to debate, to influence and to lead. The aim is to develop your portfolio of skills and knowledge relevant to public life through small-group tutorials and one-on-one supervision.


You'll benefit from the option to spend three months on a fully-integrated placement at Westminster or studying abroad with one of our partner institutions.
