COURSE OVERVIEW

Sorry, this course is now closed for applications to study in 2022.


This course has been launched at the specific request of local healthcare providers to meet a critical shortage of physiotherapists – so the career prospects for graduates could hardly be better.


The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) estimates that at least 500 extra student places are needed nationally each year.


You’ll become a competent practitioner with clinical skills and knowledge to assess, evaluate, formulate and implement treatment programmes in a diverse range of settings.
