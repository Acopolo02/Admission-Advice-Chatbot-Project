courseName: FORENSIC-SCIENCE-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

At Hull, we teach you much more than just the theory of forensic science. Here we’ll take you from crime scene to court room going beyond the lecture theatre to gain practical experience in crime scene investigation, analyse evidence in the laboratory and learn how to be an expert witness in court.


Forensic science is one of the fastest growing sectors and this course prepares you for a range of careers.


You'll gain the essential knowledge and fundamental skills to become a competent and confident forensic scientist with a significant focus on practice to application. We'll support you to develop critical thinking skills and teach you how to present clearly supported/evidenced opinions as you progress through the course. You'll also be able to make use of our excellent links with local police forces.
