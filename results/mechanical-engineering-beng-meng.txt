courseName: MECHANICAL-ENGINEERING-BENG-MENG
COURSE OVERVIEW

Mechanical engineers are involved in the design and development of almost everything we use - from nanotechnology to healthcare equipment to planes, windfarms and even spacecraft. The skills you will learn are highly sought after by employers. By studying mechanical engineering you can look forward to good job prospects and a varied and fulfilling career.


Hull has an excellent reputation for teaching Mechanical Engineering. We’re ranked #10 in the UK for learning opportunities in the National Student Survey 2021. This programme shares a common first year with the other engineering subjects in the Department of Engineering, making it possible for you to switch between degrees at the end of the first year if you want to choose a different pathway.


The first year programme gives you the core theoretical and practical skills you’ll need throughout your time at university and beyond. CAD, programming and control and thermo fluids are just a few of the areas you’ll cover. The mathematics module is specifically geared towards engineering applications.
