COURSE OVERVIEW

This hands-on degree will ensure that you develop the professional skills and knowledge to prepare you for your future career.


Gain a thorough grounding in economics supported by an attractive combination of cutting-edge skills in handling economic data and analytics relevant to industry, society and government.


This programme is designed to be hands-on with real-world relevance – concentrating on critical global and regional economic challenges such as climate change, financial crises, healthcare and social development, growth and productivity – to ensure that you develop the professional skills and knowledge that will prepare you for your future career.


You’ll learn in industry-standard facilities like our Bloomberg suite, which offers real-time financial trading simulations – so you can practise in realistic scenarios before you go out there and do it for real.


Make connections with professional industry networks, like-minded entrepreneurs, and corporate partners in our newly enhanced Business Lounge. Conveniently located in the Business School, it’s a vibrant hub for organisations to collaborate and work creatively, as well as helping to build links with our programmes, including placement and live business project opportunities that are embedded throughout your studies. It’s also a great space for our students to meet, learn from, and make an impression on decision-makers, laying the foundations for your future career – all on campus.


In your final year, you will also have the chance to spend three months on an internship. This is in addition to the extra option of studying abroad or spending a year on placement in industry, with past placements taking place at global organisations such as HP, Volkswagen and GE Healthcare.
