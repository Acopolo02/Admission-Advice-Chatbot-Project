COURSE OVERVIEW

Combine your passion for writing and film at a university with a strong heritage in both. This exciting course invites you to be part of the University’s thriving literary and creative scene.


You’ll develop confidence in your writing through core skills and techniques, experimenting with forms including scriptwriting, non-fiction, short stories, the novel and poetry, as well as genres from fantasy and science fiction to myth and fairy tale. You’ll learn how to approach film and television as art, history, culture, entertainment and commerce.


Our staff are creative practitioners and experts in their field, fans of the creative arts as much as they are enthusiastic tutors and academics.


At Hull, you'll benefit from a range of opportunities outside of your studies. In creative writing, you can get involved with our active, student-led English Society and Write HU, as well as participate in termly Writing Showcases celebrating our students' work.


And in film - there are opportunities to experience on a placement. This could be through our involvement with Screen Yorkshire's Connected Campus: a scheme which can help prepare you for life in the film and TV industry through masterclasses, workshops and visiting speakers.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
