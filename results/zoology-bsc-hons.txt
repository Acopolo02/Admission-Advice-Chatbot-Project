courseName: ZOOLOGY-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Zoology is all about animals, whether you just want to understand them better or work to protect the amazing biodiversity of this planet. 


This course focuses on a blend of laboratory and field-based practical teaching, as we recognise the need to work across disciplinary boundaries to solve global issues.


You’ll control the emphasis of your studies with opportunities to focus on species that interest you across a range of contexts including conservation, ecology, behaviour, evolution, environmental management, physiology, cell biology and genetics – allowing you to build a course to suit your passions and ambitions.


Our research has global impact on the planet and the people on it, which makes for a wide choice of final-year projects, with particular specialisms in the evolution of behaviour and the monitoring, management, and conservation of wildlife.


Learning in the field is an integral part of the course and there are lots of opportunities for residential field trips in the UK and abroad. Recent overseas trips have included Mallorca, Malaysia and Brazil.

moduleName Marine Biology: An Introduction
moduleName Marine Biology: An Introduction
moduleName From space, the planet is blue. Marine life has evolved into a myriad of forms living in some of the most extreme habitats on the planet; from great depths to battered coasts. This introduction to marine biology explores the marine environment, the diversity of life within it and how to conserve it.

Second Year
moduleName Vertebrate Zoology
moduleName Vertebrate Zoology
moduleName This module provides an integrated view of vertebrate biology by showing how changes over time and geography drive morphology, physiology, behaviour, and ecology in different vertebrates. Structure-function relationships are presented to appreciate how different animals evolve similar solutions and adaptations to the same ecological challenge while closely-related animals diversify in response to different environmental challenges.
