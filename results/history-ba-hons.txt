COURSE OVERVIEW

Illuminating the past. Engaging the present. Shaping the future.


Our understanding of History influences how we live our lives today.


As a student of History at the University of Hull, you will work to uncover the historical roots of contemporary social, political and environmental challenges. From classical civilisations to modern communities you will explore how all different periods of history continue to influence and shape our world, and to help us understand it better. We’ll ask you to engage with social and cultural history, with war and politics, with the powerful and the underdog, with sudden events and with long term change.


To equip you for the real world, assessments have been designed to allow you to develop the range of skills and competencies you will need for the workplace. Instead of having a series of unseen exams, you'll be encouraged to express your ideas in a variety of ways, to criticise sources of historical information from newspapers to computer games, and to develop your own ideas through channels such as podcasts and online exhibitions.


Throughout your studies with us, you’ll develop key techniques for historians, gaining transferable skills of analysis, digital literacy, teamwork and communication. You will also have opportunities to enhance your employability and breadth of interests beyond your degree through voluntary placements with the Hull History Network.


Under the guidance of expert academics – and benefiting from facilities such as the Hull History Centre – you’ll discover the drama of the past, understand the great challenges of the present, and gain the skills to help shape a brighter future for yourself and the world we live in.

courseModules 
First Year
moduleName History of Freedom
moduleName History of Freedom
moduleName What does it mean to be free and how has the answer to this question changed over time? In ancient and medieval times, there was no expectation of individual freedom as we understand it today, rather there were degrees of ‘unfreedom’ such as slavery, serfdom, or vassalage. Later, in the age of empire, race determined who could be enslaved, and the slave trade’s legacies of racism persist into the present day: the civil rights movements and the struggle against apartheid are known as some of the most prominent recent fights for freedom. Nonetheless, the idea of freedom has far broader connotations, and you will also have the flexibility to explore diverse issues such as religious, cultural or personal freedoms.

moduleName Revolutions: Continuity and Change
moduleName Revolutions: Continuity and Change
moduleName Revolutions are processes and events of profound and enduring change, but they are not just about politics. Before the great revolutions in America, France, Haiti and Russia, global history experienced sweeping changes in society, ideas and technology. Revolutions are not modern phenomena, and they do not belong strictly to Europe: they are ancient and they have taken place all over the globe since the beginning of ‘recorded’ history. This module will widen your perspective on ‘revolutions’ by examining a number of revolutionary moments in world history, from ancient times to the present. These will range across technological, social, religious and political revolutions.

moduleName All Roads Lead from Rome: the Classical Present
moduleName All Roads Lead from Rome: the Classical Present
moduleName No matter how modern we think we are, we’re still shaped by the classical past. In every age, the classical world has been used as a benchmark for good taste and has been re-invented for present purposes. Using the artworks, archaeology and artefacts of material and visual culture, this module will explore topics such as how the classical world provided a blueprint for the projection of power through imagery and architecture. From the posturing of great leaders, such as the portraits of Napoleon, to the grand civic buildings of Washington DC or Albert Speer’s designs for Hitler’s Berlin, the classical world has been influential throughout history.

moduleName Human Worlds
moduleName Human Worlds
moduleName How have humans shaped their environment, and how has the environment shaped them in return? These questions have controlled how and where we live. The availability of resources has encouraged migration and movement from the trade routes of the Silk Road across Asia to the imperial web of coaling stations that developed for the projection of naval power. How do cities grow – like St Petersburg, Delhi or Paris, built and rebuilt that has affected how generations of inhabitants later would live their lives?

moduleName World War Tudors
moduleName World War Tudors
moduleName Why are TV programmes so obsessed with certain episodes in British history such as the Tudors and the world wars? What idea of Britain is conveyed when we focus on a narrow range of stories like Boudicca’s fight against Rome, victory at Agincourt, Henry VIII’s wives or the Battle of Britain? What gets left out of British history in these simplified versions of the past? This module will invite you to critique popular culture, such as television documentaries or computer games, and to create different fresh ideas for how you think the public could engage with an aspect of the past that inspires you.

moduleName History: Then and Now
moduleName History: Then and Now
moduleName This module explores how historians shape and debate the past. Should we study the past on its own terms as we act as neutral observers who are guided by what the sources tell us, or do historians mould the past into their own image, re-writing history for new purposes depending on each historian’s subjective preferences? In this module, we will consider these questions of objectivity, facts, bias, distortion, as well as the need for historians to return to the past and consider it from points of view that are relevant to the present.

moduleName The First Superpowers
moduleName The First Superpowers
moduleName While Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union were the dominant nations of the 19th and 20th centuries, they were not the first superpowers. Some of the world’s most powerful entities of pre-modern times were found in Asia, pre-colonial North America, and in the heart of Europe. The ancient and modern world was formed by superpowers, from the Qin Dynasty of ancient China, to the equestrian empires of the Lakota and Comanche, to the Holy Roman and Ottoman empires that shaped history at the centre and edges of an expanding Europe.

moduleName Three Sixties: Decades that Changed the World
moduleName Tracing how themes such as war & technology, ideas & rights, and culture & morality changed in three different decades: the 1760s, the 1860s and the 1960s. Each of these trends were shaped by changing trading and communication networks, economic developments and shifting notions of leisure and class, and thus enable us to reflect on the interconnectedness of these ideas and their spread around the globe.

moduleName Trends and Treasures
moduleName Trends and Treasures
moduleName Using the framework of ‘Treasures and Trends’ we seek to examine how and why different societies (at different points in time) value and classify visual and material remains of the past, often in order to negotiate and understand their contemporary relevance. Looking at trends and fashion as a barometer of taste, popularity, consumerism and acquisitiveness also allows us to explore ways in which these have been shaped by, and further gave shape to material and visual culture, often involving complex networks of trade and exchange that connect local and national histories with wider global forces.

moduleName Insiders and Outsiders: Community and Belonging in History
moduleName Insiders and Outsiders: Community and Belonging in History
moduleName For the ancient Greeks, citizens ruled. But their notion of a citizen was exclusive: men ruled over women, children, slaves, animals and things. In ancient societies, most people were excluded from power, participation, markets, resources and opportunity – they were ‘outsiders’. Over time, or so the story goes, societies have worked to ensure the inclusion of outsiders, whether through voting rights, civil rights, access to educational and career opportunities. This module explores the ways in which groups, communities, and nations determine and decide: who belongs.

moduleName New Frontiers: Small Steps and Giant Leaps in History
moduleName This module examines new frontiers: spaces where the old meets the new, and where we can see the operation of profound shifts in politics, society, technology and the environment. Humans have always applied their curiosity to the world around them, inventing, exploring, building, and reshaping themselves and their environments. In some instances, this has resulted in profoundly creative advances, and in others it has unleashed processes of disruption and destruction. In this module, you will explore past and present-day examples where humans have opened up new frontiers.

moduleName Fear and Terror
moduleName Fear and Terror
moduleName Are fear and terror the tools of the weak or of the strong? Totalitarian regimes from Stalin to Pinochet’s Chile have used extreme violence, secret police and state sponsored terrorism and assassination to assert their authority. Meanwhile, non-state actors, such as the IRA, Al-Qaeda and the ANC, relatively small in terms of number and weak in terms of infrastructure, have used campaigns of sporadic violence to effect change. Are they ever justified in doing so? Sometimes terror tactics have had important racial and ethnic dimensions as in the exercise of colonial power and in genocidal campaigns. In wartime, is the inducement of fear unavoidable or are atrocities deliberate? Are some acts beyond the pale, to be punished as war crimes? Can Truth and Reconciliation activities in the wake of such acts achieve their goals.
