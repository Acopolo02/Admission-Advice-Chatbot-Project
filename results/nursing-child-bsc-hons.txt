Paediatric and child-focused nursing is among the most rewarding careers out there. You'll learn to work and communicate with children and their families – often in difficult, demanding situations.

On graduation, you'll be able to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) as a qualified registered nurse.
