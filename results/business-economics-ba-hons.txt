courseName: BUSINESS-ECONOMICS-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Combine economics with a focus on how today’s business managers make decisions.


You will learn to apply the concepts and analytical tools of economics to a diverse range of real-world problems, while learning to construct arguments and effectively communicate to a wide range of audiences.


The ability to understand and assess the impact of public policy on industry and society, as well as diverse business issues such as digitisation and technological change, the development of market economies, social inequality, and Brexit, ensures you will have the skills and knowledge that are attractive to a range of employers across both public and private sectors.


Plus, you’ll have even more opportunities than ever before to make connections with like-minded entrepreneurs, organisations and corporate partners in our recently enhanced Business Lounge. And you'll have access to the Business School's industry-standard facilities like the Bloomberg and Executive Education suites. Or you could help SMEs with their challenges via our Business Clinic. 


In your final year, you will also have the chance to spend three months on an internship. This is in addition to the extra option of studying abroad or spending a year on placement in industry.
