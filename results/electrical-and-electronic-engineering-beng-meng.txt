courseName: ELECTRICAL-AND-ELECTRONIC-ENGINEERING-BENG-MENG
COURSE OVERVIEW

From aerospace engineering, health care and mobile phones to the growing need for renewable energy solutions, electronic and electrical systems are constantly evolving. So the demand for talented engineers continues to rise.


Engineers and technologists are needed across all industries. So when you graduate, you'll find varied, challenging and rewarding careers developing the technology that touches every strand of modern life.


Our Electrical and Electronic Engineering degrees are fully accredited by the Institution of Engineering and Technology. They count as recognised qualifications on the way to Chartered Engineer status.


But it’s not all study and work - there are lots of extra-curricular activities for you to get involved with as well. Become part of our Hull Electric Racing team and you could be building a single seater racing car and competing against other students at Silverstone. There’s a robotics society and you’ll have access to our state-of-the-art FabLab, packed with 3D printers to build your prototypes.
