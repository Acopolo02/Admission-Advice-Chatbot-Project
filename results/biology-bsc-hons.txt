courseName: BIOLOGY-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Biology at Hull is all about tackling global challenges, from genetic engineering through to climate change. 


You’ll gain real world practical skills in the lab and in the field, and learn to communicate important topics in biology to diverse audiences. You'll study in a supportive and friendly department with access to industry standard facilities.


This degree reflects the breadth of modern biological sciences, with core topics including genetics and genomics, microbiology, evolution, cell biology and biological diversity. We’ll help you build your degree around your interests, like molecular genomics, toxicology, applied ecology or other specialist topics. Fascinated by human biology? You can also take modules from biomedical sciences. Or if you’re interested in all areas of biology you can take a broad range of options - the choice is yours.

moduleName Vertebrate Zoology
moduleName Vertebrate Zoology
moduleName This module provides an integrated view of vertebrate biology by showing how changes over time and geography drive morphology, physiology, behaviour, and ecology in different vertebrates. Structure-function relationships are presented to appreciate how different animals evolve similar solutions and adaptations to the same ecological challenge while closely-related animals diversify in response to different environmental challenges.

moduleName Molecular Evolution and Genomics
moduleName Molecular Evolution and Genomics
moduleName This module will focus on the big topics in molecular evolution. What do genomes contain and why? How do we build trees from DNA sequences? How can recombination or gene duplication or transposons lead to adaptation? How do we detect selection in the human genome? We’ll cover these in theory and in practice with some fascinating examples from nature.

Your tuition fees will cover most costs associated with your programme (including registration, tuition, supervision, assessment and examination).There are some extra costs that you might have to pay, or choose to pay, depending on your programme of study and the decisions you make. The list below has some examples, and any extra costs will vary.

Books (you’ll have access to books from your module reading lists in the library, but you may want to buy your own copies)
Optional field trips
Study abroad (including travel costs, accommodation, visas, immunisation)
Placement costs (including travel costs and accommodation)
Student visas (international students)
Laptop (you’ll have access to laptops and PC’s on campus, but you may want to buy your own)
