courseName: CRIMINOLOGY-WITH-PSYCHOLOGY-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

On this degree, you’ll learn to understand crime, the human mind and how the two overlap and interact. As well as exploring topics in crime and criminal justice, you’ll study human behaviour, performance and decision making.


You’ll consider the decisions that criminals make (why a burglar chooses one house over another, for example). You'll discover the psychological origins of crime and how psychology can inform crime detection or reduce offending.


You can also choose to investigate areas including drug use, sex work, surveillance, slavery and cyberterrorism.


When you choose one of our Criminology degrees, you’ll get the chance to apply for a semester-long placement with Humberside Police**. You’ll work with areas like CSI, the Special Branch Ports Unit, community policing, cyber crime and the custody suite. And you’ll visit crime scenes, observe interviews and collect evidence.


It also means you'll get a range of amazing opportunities to explore criminology in real-life situations, such as through placements, field trips to courts, and police stations and prisons. Recent students have also had the opportunity to investigate policing and security issues.


Put what you learn into practice in our purpose-built replica crime scene facility right here on campus. A recent addition to the university, it provides detailed and realistic crime scenes for you to explore. Get hands on: collect evidence, explore criminal activity and see the world of forensic science brought to life.
