courseName: CRIMINOLOGY-AND-SOCIOLOGY-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Criminology and sociology are a logical – and valuable – combination of subjects. Crime happens in social contexts. Sociology helps us understand those contexts. Demand for criminologists with insight into crime’s impact on society is higher than ever.


This course can train you to meet that demand.  Through real-world examples, you'll explore crime’s effect on society and how society responds to crime.


You'll consider your own attitudes to crime, criminals and victims. And you’ll study topics like the relationship between the individual and society, the concept of deviance and how offenders are punished.


When you choose one of our Criminology degrees, you’ll get the chance to apply for a semester-long placement with Humberside Police**. You’ll work with areas like CSI, the Special Branch Ports Unit, community policing, cyber crime and the custody suite. And you’ll visit crime scenes, observe interviews and collect evidence.


It also means you'll get a range of amazing opportunities to explore criminology in real-life situations, such as through placements, field trips to courts, and police stations and prisons. Recent students have also had the opportunity to investigate policing and security issues.


Put what you learn into practice in our purpose-built replica crime scene facility right here on campus. A recent addition to the university, it provides detailed and realistic crime scenes for you to explore. Get hands on: collect evidence, explore criminal activity and see the world of forensic science brought to life.
