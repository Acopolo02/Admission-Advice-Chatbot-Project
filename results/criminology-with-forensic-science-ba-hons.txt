courseName: CRIMINOLOGY-WITH-FORENSIC-SCIENCE-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

On this degree, you’ll debate the practical, ethical and scientific issues around criminality and punishment. You'll also come to understand the science behind the collection, processing and preservation of evidence.


But this course goes beyond the theoretical – with major components of practical, hands-on learning. You’ll get experience of crime scene investigation and analysing evidence in the lab.


You’ll learn specialist investigation methods including document evaluation, fire and firearms investigation, and explosion site CSI. You'll visit courts, police stations and prisons. And you’ll discover how to interpret evidence and how to present your findings in scientific, medical and legal contexts.


When you choose one of our Criminology degrees, you’ll get the chance to apply for a semester-long placement with Humberside Police**. You’ll work with areas like CSI, the Special Branch Ports Unit, community policing, cyber crime and the custody suite. And you’ll visit crime scenes, observe interviews and collect evidence.


It also means you'll get a range of amazing opportunities to explore criminology in real-life situations, such as through placements, field trips to courts, and police stations and prisons. Recent students have also had the opportunity to investigate policing and security issues.


Put what you learn into practice in our purpose-built replica crime scene facility right here on campus. A recent addition to the university, it provides detailed and realistic crime scenes for you to explore. Get hands on: collect evidence, explore criminal activity and see the world of forensic science brought to life.


You can also expand your skills and experience through a range of rewarding volunteering opportunities - such as the Appropriate Adult scheme, and have the opportunity to hear from, and network with employers from the sector at our well established annual Careers in Criminal Justice event.


You will learn from lecturers who are experts in a wide variety of areas within criminology – including modern-day slavery, knife crime and cyber terrorism – alongside experienced Forensic practitioners using the most advanced concepts and methodologies to develop your scientific knowledge. Together they bring their specialist knowledge into the lecture theatre and help you define and develop your own areas of interest.
