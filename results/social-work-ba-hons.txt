courseName: SOCIAL-WORK-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Taught by experts with real-world experience, you’ll study issues like homelessness, drug and alcohol use, disability and mental health as well as social welfare policies and the safeguarding of adults and children.


Fundamentally, you'll develop the skills to work with adults, children and young people in a range of circumstances and learn how to safeguard and protect people where required.


Social workers support people when they need it most. You’ll also engage with their families and liaise with organisations like the police, the NHS and schools.


We're founder members of the Humber Social Work Teaching Partnership, giving you access to local employers of social work practitioners. And thanks to those strong relationships, you'll get a range of placement experiences from inner city to market towns and seaside resorts. This provides you with a breadth of experience that makes you highly employable after graduation.


This programme is accredited by Social Work England which means you can apply to register as a qualified social worker on graduation. It also means you could be eligible to receive support from the NHS Social Work Bursary Scheme, which could help significantly with your living and study costs.
