courseName: POLITICS-AND-INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

This is the study of politics on a grand scale. Explore the themes and issues which drive 21st-century world politics, on a course which takes in conflict, poverty, inequality and trade.


Our Politics and International Relations degree takes you behind the headlines to gain expertise in international affairs – and you’ll have the opportunity to complete a semester abroad or an internship, either in Westminster or with one of our public- and private-sector partners.


This is an intellectually demanding programme, taught by staff who are recognised for their research. That's reflected in the range of modules available, and in the flexibility of the degree. You can tailor the course to fit your interests and career aspirations.
