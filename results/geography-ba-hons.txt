courseName: GEOGRAPHY-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Geography explores the dynamic, complex and related physical and human processes that make the world work. Studying geography will give you the skills to help tackle the world’s biggest issues and to look at places with an expert and critical eye.


Human geographers are interested in how society responds to environmental issues, including the range of different possibilities and perspectives, and understanding how they compete with each other. BA Geography focuses on topics within social science and humanities such as sustainability and development, cities and globalisation and people culture and space.


Here at Hull, you’ll be introduced to geography’s key theoretical ideas and practical approaches. We specialise in tackling the major issues: from globalisation and sustainability to climate change and geohazards.


All our Geography programmes have a common first year in which you’ll get to study human and physical geography and learn geographical skills. In your second and third year in BA Geography, you can continue to do both human and physical geography, or choose to focus on human geography - the choice is yours.
