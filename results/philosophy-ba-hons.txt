courseName: PHILOSOPHY-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Studying philosophy at Hull means doing philosophy: engaging with current issues and emerging philosophical challenges. That will help you to build and use the skills and methods that only a training in philosophy can provide.


You'll grapple with fundamental questions about the nature of reality, consciousness and what it is to be human. You'll debate the issues of the day, from cutting-edge genetics to artificial intelligence that will equip you to shape your own future and the world around you.


And you can get involved with Peer-Assisted Study Sessions (PASS), where our philosophy students hand down their enthusiasm and wisdom from one year group to the next.

courseModules 
First Year
moduleName Creation, Persistence and Destruction: Problems in Metaphysics
moduleName Creation, Persistence and Destruction: Problems in Metaphysics
moduleName Metaphysical questions apply to everything you can think of: natural objects, living organisms, human beings, human artefacts, imaginary objects, abstract entities, timeless universals, and supernatural phenomena. You'll consider up-to-date versions of classical metaphysical problems by analysing interesting contemporary arguments and identifying a breadth of examples of that are relevant to the world around us. Sensitively exploring different perspectives and sharing ideas will help us notice how fundamental metaphysical perspectives are often the basis of deep disagreements in ethics, aesthetics, and religious belief, particularly when the metaphysics of the mind, body and self are in question.

moduleName Knowing Now: Problems in Epistemology
moduleName Knowing Now: Problems in Epistemology
moduleName This module examines one of the central issues in philosophy – what it is to know something. We will distinguish knowledge from mere opinion and critically evaluate common views about where knowledge comes from, what it is based on and how it is justified. We will give particular focus to the ways in which knowledge, and claims to knowledge, are culturally shaped and informed, and so how traditions, perspectives and social structures influence our views about knowledge.

moduleName Our Digital Age: Philosophical Perspectives on Humanity, Technology and Nature
moduleName Our Digital Age: Philosophical Perspectives on Humanity, Technology and Nature
moduleName Examine what it is to be ‘human’ in an ever-more technological age. As humans we have traditionally distinguished ourselves from other animals while, at the same time, sharing much of our bodily circumstances and natural environment with them. In recent decades bodily, neurological and pharmaceutical enhancements, and in particular the increasingly virtual nature of our existence and interactions, have stretched our traditional concepts of ‘humanity’. You'll apply and develop your philosophical skills in critically examining the many challenges and opportunities that arise from these issues.
