courseName: FILM-STUDIES-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

You could hardly choose a better place to study film. As the region grows in popularity as a film location, so do opportunities to get real-world experience in the industry.


Some work experience opportunities might arise through our involvement with Screen Yorkshire's Connected Campus: a scheme which can help you prepare for life in the film and TV industry through masterclasses, workshops and visiting speakers.


You'll benefit from brand-new facilities – like the refurbished Middleton Hall, where we've invested £9.5 million to create a superb venue featuring a surround-sound cinema and an industry-standard filming and editing suite, along with our dedicated on-campus TV, film and digital media facilities.


You’ll be taught by enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff who are film fans as much they are academics. They include Dr Amy Davis, an internationally respected Disney scholar, as well as experts in horror, East Asian cinema and TV drama.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
