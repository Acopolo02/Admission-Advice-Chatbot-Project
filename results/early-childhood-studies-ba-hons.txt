COURSE OVERVIEW

This rewarding, flexible degree gives you the skills and knowledge to move into the early years workforce and has babies and young children at its heart.


The degree takes a holistic approach to the development of young children, from birth to the age of eight and provides opportunities to apply this learning in placement settings.


Early childhood is a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and global area of study that draws on subjects such as education, health studies, social work and social policy, psychology and sociology.


The experience of early childhood is changing rapidly across the world. From climate change, global pandemics and economic austerity to a childhood increasingly dominated by screens and social media, the 21st century has brought many challenges and factors that are shaping childhood experiences. The BA Early Childhood Studies at the University of Hull looks to support the development of practitioners for the early childhood sector who understand and have the skills to respond to the challenges of supporting children and babies in this rapidly changing world.
