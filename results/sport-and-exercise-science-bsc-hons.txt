COURSE OVERVIEW

Where else can you get opportunities to learn from Team GB? Nowhere else. Because Hull is the only official university partner of Team GB. We’re well connected locally too: professional sports teams, the NHS, nutritional health providers, schools. That means lots of hands-on placement opportunities, CV-boosting volunteering and career-inspiring  


Why study it here?


First, your work placement is already built into your degree. So you get to apply the scientific theory of physiology, psychology and biomechanics with hands-on experience.


You can tap into our close links with Hull City, Hull KR and Hull FC: all three clubs have former Hull students working for them.


Plus the NHS, City Health Care Partnership, First Step Sport, Body Type Nutrition, Hull Sport and many local schools. And, of course, our partners Team GB – more on them later…


Second, you’ve got some of the best facilities in the industry on your doorstep. Like our Health and Human Performance Lab, Environmental Chamber and Exercise Physiology Labs.


And then there’s our new £16-million sports centre, and the opportunity to join one or more of the 50 Athletic Union clubs run by the students’ union.


Third, you join a university that invests in your potential. Each year, we award scholarships on our Talented Athlete Programme. As well as a cash award, you get personal support to suit you and your sport.
