courseName: PSYCHOLOGY-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Choose Psychology at Hull and you’ll explore the most fascinating subject of all – the human mind.


Psychology has been a key area of study at Hull since 1928, spanning major milestones in the discipline from Freudian theory to the introduction of high-tech brain scanners. This accredited degree will provide you with a firm foundation in the core areas of psychological science – while giving you the option to study the topics that interest you in greater depth.


You’ll study fascinating areas such as memory, social relationships, child development, the ageing brain and forensics. And you’ll develop practical and technical skills which can help tackle real-life issues such as dementia, under the guidance of professional psychologists.


Our specialist facilities include an electroencephalography (EEG) machine for measuring activity in the brain and a well-equipped brain stimulation laboratory. You’ll study in a friendly, supportive department that has strong links with the NHS as well as the private sector; all of which helps ensure what you’re learning is industry-relevant.


Psychology students at Hull have access to their own social area too. The bright, modern space has seating areas where you can meet before and after lectures and is a great space for group study. 


The unique link between our BSc Psychology and our doctorate in Clinical Psychology offers you a fast track to qualification while having your doctorate fees paid – and receiving a salary from the NHS.


You can also study for a semester in countries like Norway, Germany and Malta. Classes are taught in English and you’ll expand your cultural and subject knowledge while you’re there.


Our lecturers are at the cutting edge of psychology research. And that expertise inspires their teaching too, making sure what you learn is the most up-to-date theory and practice. Our research has real-life applications, like our work with international manufacturer Siemens. We are studying the psychological effects of the tough environment that wind turbine engineers must face while working out in the North Sea. Our psychologists are helping Siemens better understand this to support their engineers in their vital work and keep them safe.
