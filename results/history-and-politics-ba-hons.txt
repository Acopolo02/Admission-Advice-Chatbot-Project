courseName: HISTORY-AND-POLITICS-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

History and Politics are a natural combination. Knowledge of the past helps us to understand the present. And current politics provides insights into history. 


On this degree, you’ll study the progress of people, events and government through time. And you could get to see modern politics functioning first hand on a three-month internship at Westminster. This flexible course lets you tailor your studies to suit your own interests and career plans.


Inspired by the rich history of Hull and its particular contribution to national politics, this degree will enhance your understanding of the human experience over the long term. And it'll enable you to apply historical insights to the study of present-day politics and governance.

moduleName History of Freedom
moduleName History of Freedom
moduleName What does it mean to be free and how has the answer to this question changed over time? In ancient and medieval times, there was no expectation of individual freedom as we understand it today, rather there were degrees of ‘unfreedom’ such as slavery, serfdom, or vassalage. Later, in the age of empire, race determined who could be enslaved, and the slave trade’s legacies of racism persist into the present day: the civil rights movements and the struggle against apartheid are known as some of the most prominent recent fights for freedom. Nonetheless, the idea of freedom has far broader connotations, and you will also have the flexibility to explore diverse issues such as religious, cultural or personal freedoms.

moduleName How have humans shaped their environment, and how has the environment shaped them in return? These questions have controlled how and where we live.

How do cities grow – like St Petersburg, Delhi or Paris, built and rebuilt that has affected how generations of inhabitants later would live their lives?
