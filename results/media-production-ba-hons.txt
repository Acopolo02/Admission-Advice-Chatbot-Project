courseName: MEDIA-PRODUCTION-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Build the creative, organisational, personal and technical skills to thrive in the creative and media industries, where you’ll tell the stories of the region, the nation and the world in all their diversity.


You’ll benefit from the Screen Yorkshire Connected Campus scheme, which connects regional universities to the booming regional screen industry with careers advice, skills workshops, and developing collaboration between universities and regional film and television producers.


Develop your skills and experience across a range of production spaces, from a multi-purpose studio to a fully operational on-campus theatre, and gain experience in location filmmaking. And you’ll have exclusive access to our media labs, home to the latest digital media software and hardware used in the industry today, along with our dedicated on-campus TV, film and digital media facilities.


These skills are developed through two main programme strands. The first focuses on the creative processes of media production, including technical expertise, individual and group planning, and safe working practices. The second focuses on key aspects of the sector, including diversity, entrepreneurship, and the legal and organisational realities of the sector, which are crucial for any practicing professional to understand and embrace.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
