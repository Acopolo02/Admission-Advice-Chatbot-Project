COURSE OVERVIEW

First, you won’t have to wait until you graduate to start making a difference to people’s lives.


You get the chance to provide real legal advice to real clients at our Legal Advice Centre and our recently enhanced Mediation Centre.


This means you could be helping parents regain contact with their children, advising clients on divorce and property rights, and assisting with appeals against benefits decisions.


And you can even take part in internships with local law firms and government, and mini-pupillages with Wilberforce Chambers. As well as have the opportunity to take part in rewarding volunteering projects, such as the Appropriate Adult scheme.


Second, you can hone your debating skills in our authentic mock courtrooms. Our new state-of-the-art court allows you to bring the courtroom to life right here on campus. Take part in mock trials to practice your skills and prepare for your future career. Our Student Law Society organises regular mooting competitions, as well as client interview practice.


Third, our hands-on Real-World Law module is developed in partnership with a range of leading local law firms.
