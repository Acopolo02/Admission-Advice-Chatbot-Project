COURSE OVERVIEW

Scientists at Hull paved the way for the LCD display technology that's on your smartphone, laptop, tablet and TV. We’ve changed the world once. Want to help do it again?


Chemistry here is a hands-on subject with excellent career prospects. We’re in a region with a high concentration of chemical companies – including BP, Total, RB (Reckitt Benckiser), Philips 66, Croda, and Smith & Nephew – which gives you lots of scope to find placements. It also means we can set up mentoring arrangements for you with professional scientists from local industry. And our graduates often find work with these major companies.


Our course covers analytical, forensic, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry, with modules on topics such as materials chemistry, spectrostropic methods, computational chemistry and many others. You gain a broad, balanced knowledge of the array of subjects that make up modern chemistry – and the opportunity to extend that knowledge into cutting-edge areas. You develop investigative and problem-solving skills that prepare you to succeed in industry.


Chemistry at Hull is taught by the leaders in the field. You’ll be taught by staff who’ve won awards for the quality of their teaching and for developing innovative approaches. Some of them have written the textbooks you’ll use during your studies. You’ll also be trained and inspired by research leaders in the field across all our subject areas. We have experts in the synthesis of cancer therapeutics compounds, materials chemists preparing new compounds for advanced applications and specialists in lab-on-a-chip miniaturised chemistry for testing water purity in isolated locations.


And we’ve got the tools to back up your talent. You’ll benefit from our recent investments in chemistry, including the latest mass spectrometry facilities and new resources – including laser technology for elemental analysis and a microfluidic fabrication capability.


Excited? So are we.


George W Gray International Scholarship


To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the University of Hull’s pioneering work in liquid crystals, we are offering up to 20 international scholarships to study chemistry at Hull. Named in honour of the chemist who pioneered this world-changing discovery, the George W Gray Scholarship is worth £9,000 a year for every year of your degree and will be awarded to eligible students as a tuition fee discount.
