COURSE OVERVIEW

Gain the skills to save lives and succeed in a global industry worth more than £300 billion.


Apply engineering principles and scientific methods to solve problems in medicine and healthcare in this programme which combines engineering, medicine and biology.


You'll learn from experts who teach advanced ideas on the application of mechanical engineering for a range of medical purposes, encompassing industry-standard computer-based methods and experimental techniques.


Medical engineering is one of the fastest growing and most dynamic sectors of the economy.


Mechanical and Medical Engineering at Hull is highly rated by our students. We're ranked second in the UK for student satisfaction in Medical and Biomedical Engineering and number 1 for the organisation and management of the course. And we're in the top ten for teaching, learning opportunities, assessment and feedback, academic support, learning resources and community and student voice too*.


But it’s not all study and work - there are lots of extra-curricular activities for you to get involved with as well. Become part of our Hull Electric Racing team and you could be building a single seater racing car and competing against other students at Silverstone. There’s a robotics society and you’ll have access to our state-of-the-art FabLab, packed with 3D printers to build your prototypes.
