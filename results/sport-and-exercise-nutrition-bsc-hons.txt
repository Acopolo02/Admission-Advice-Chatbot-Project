courseName: SPORT-AND-EXERCISE-NUTRITION-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Learn to help athletes and physically active people improve their performance through exercise physiology and nutritional practices.


The general guidelines that used to influence an individual's sport and exercise performance have become vague and outdated. So here you'll study a dynamic, evidence-based, situation-specific degree, which facilitates performance enhancement.


You'll refine your understanding of nutrition, exercise physiology and psychology. You'll transfer the theory into real-world practical situations in specialist facilities, including our Health and Human Performance Laboratory, Exercise Physiology Laboratories, using showcase catering facilities and on work placement.


This programme is accredited by the Sport and Exercise Nutrition Register (SENR) and abides by the SENR competency framework. It also prepares you to become a sport and exercise nutritionist not just in the UK, but further afield – thanks to our accreditation by the Hong Kong Nutritionists Society (HKNS).
