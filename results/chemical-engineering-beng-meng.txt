courseName: CHEMICAL-ENGINEERING-BENG-MENG
COURSE OVERVIEW

Chemical engineering applies science to the design, construction and operation of processes used to change raw materials into useful everyday products. Food and drink. Pharmaceuticals. Fertilisers. Energy. Fuels. A chemical engineering degree will give you excellent job prospects and equip you with skills that are easily transferable across industry sectors.


Hull is the ideal location to study chemical engineering. We’re in a region with a high concentration of process industry companies - BP, Total, Phillips 66, Smith & Nephew, Reckitt and many more are right on our doorstep.


Our courses have a strong chemistry content, allowing you to pursue a subject you enjoyed at college.


Right from your first year, you’ll get the chance to do process safety training. This is highly valued by employers and helps you to stand out in the jobs market. The training is delivered by a professional company and includes visits to one of the UK's best training facilities.There, you can experience life as a chemical engineer, using real equipment and operating procedures to identify the type of hazards you could come across in your career. Back on campus, you can oversee a real-time 3D simulation of a chemical process plant in our virtual control room.
