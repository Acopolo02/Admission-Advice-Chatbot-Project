courseName: NURSING-MENTAL-HEALTH-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Sorry, this course is now closed to applications to study in 2022. You may be interested in our other Health, Nursing and Midwifery courses.


As a specialist mental health nurse, the one-to-one relationships you build with those in need are vital to their care and to helping them overcome challenges.


Half study, half mentored practice, this course develops your professional insight and empathy through diverse work experience.


The degree has a strong experiential element to it – and a focus on service user, carer and practitioner involvement. On graduation, you'll be able to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) as a qualified registered nurse.
