courseName: BIOMEDICAL-ENGINEERING-BENG-MENG
COURSE OVERVIEW

Biomedical Engineering deals with the development of medical devices – in particular, those related to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine which can be used to replace or regenerate cells, tissues and organs. 


You'll be taught by experienced engineering professionals and by NHS clinicians and clinical engineers from local hospitals. Through a combination of virtual learning systems and traditional teaching, you'll develop the techniques to solve complex problems.


You'll also learn practical dissection skills in the lab to gain a complete understanding of human anatomy and the medical engineering issues which may arise for surgeons.
