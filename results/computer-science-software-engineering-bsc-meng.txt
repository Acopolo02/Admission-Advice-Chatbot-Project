courseName: COMPUTER-SCIENCE-SOFTWARE-ENGINEERING-BSC-MENG
COURSE OVERVIEW

Software engineering is essential to the smooth running of modern life. The apps and digital tools we use everyday, driverless cars and passenger planes all require safe, usable, reliable, robust software to make them work.


All our Computer Science undergraduate courses offer a guaranteed, paid year in industry, between the second and third year, as a recognised part of your degree, giving you the chance to test your skills out in the real world.


This programme specialises in formal and user-centred techniques that you’ll need to design, develop and deploy software that delivers value to users and controls the world around us. You'll gain a strong working knowledge of computer science and the theories that underpin the discipline.


You'll develop the skills to write code, create and manage software projects using the latest agile development methods, and you’ll learn about test-driven development and DevOps.


There's also the opportunity to specialise in the areas that interest you most – ending with a major individual software project. Previous topics have included, a run planner and diary, a wind farm simulation, modelling a self driving car and an app to find and join in with live, location-based events.


This degree is accredited to the maximum level available by the British Computer Society. The skills, experience and technical expertise you’ll gain at Hull will put you in high demand when it’s time to enter the job market in this fast-moving industry.

moduleName The Programming Portfolio module provides the required practical knowledge for Computer Science students to design, implement and test algorithms. The module uses lectures to deliver concepts, a practice lab to apply the programming concepts learnt by developing programs to solve problems. You will take part in hands-on practical assessments, which will enable you to acquire extensive programming skills in an industry standard programming language. We will support you whether you are new to programming or have existing skills.

moduleName Algorithms and Data Structures
moduleName Algorithms and Data Structures
moduleName Start to think like a computer (bleep bloop)! This module explores logic, data storage and algorithms with the use of practical demonstrations and activities. Operating in parallel with programming-focussed modules, we will develop a toolkit of key concepts from a theoretical (non-code) perspective, facilitating a better understanding of these fundamentals. Topics to expect include pseudocode, state machines, essential keywords, common data structures, sort algorithms and search algorithms. You will learn methods to analyse and compare algorithms and their constituent parts in order that you may better design, evaluate and develop effective, efficient and performant software solutions.

moduleName In this module you will explore the fundamental properties of computers that allow them to execute programmes. You will learn about how Computers are made to work in hardware and simulation (Virtual Machines). A collection of Virtual Machines is a cloud, and this module allows you to get experience with the development of your own cloud using appropriate platforms.

moduleName Employers want much more than discipline specific skills. This module sets you up to grow your professional skills and awareness, when working both individually and as part of a team. You will also develop your appreciation of the challenges within the sector, and how technology can help to solve worldwide issues. You will begin a personal portfolio that you will add to over your degree and you will work as part of a team to produce a design prototype, demonstrating your personal professional development. Through researching your discipline, you will understand the range of career roles available and what you need to do to progress in them.

moduleName User Interfaces and Experience
moduleName User Interfaces and Experience
moduleName Any software or hardware used by humans needs to put human understanding at its core. Digital products succeed or fail by how well the designer understands the ability of a human to use the product, or the experience that using the product provides. You'll take a scientific and engineering approach to understanding, developing and evaluating effective interfaces and experiences for users.

moduleName Software Engineering Design Patterns
moduleName Software Engineering Design Patterns
moduleName Many problems have been solved before, so you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. One of the features of doing Software Engineering is building on the best practice developed by many others, so that you don’t fall into the same traps as earlier developers. This module will give you the chance to learn about some of the top issues in software design and the best patterns for solving them. You’ll also learn about the arts of DevOps and software testing to ensure that the solutions you create are fit for purpose and deployable.
