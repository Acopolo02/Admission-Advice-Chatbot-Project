courseName: ENVIRONMENTAL-SCIENCE-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

The need for scientists who understand the forces shaping our planet has never been greater. This degree will give you a range of practical, field and analytical skills to help you solve real environmental problems.


You’ll spend much of your time conducting field work and research. That'll be backed up by lectures, tutorials, seminars and opportunities for residential field courses in the UK and abroad.


On this accredited programme, you can apply for free student membership of The Institution of Environmental Sciences (IES), and for a fast-track route to membership after graduation. This starts you on a route towards becoming a Chartered Environmentalist or Chartered Scientist.


The programme draws on our expertise in biology, geography and geology to make a truly interdisciplinary degree – with practical skills embedded throughout.


The University cares deeply about the environment and a strong, sustainable future for everyone. We have over 80 environmental experts and world-leading scientists who make up our Energy and Environment Institute, who you will get the chance to study with and learn from. We have also committed to an ambitious plan to become carbon neutral by 2027, when we celebrate 100 years since we were first established.
