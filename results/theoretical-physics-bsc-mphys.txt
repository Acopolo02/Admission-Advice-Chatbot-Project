courseName: THEORETICAL-PHYSICS-BSC-MPHYS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Theoretical Physics at Hull can give you with the mathematical tools to gain a deep understanding of modern physics – from the sub-atomic level to a cosmological scale. You'll be guided by experts in the field with an innovative approach to teaching.


Many of our graduates progress to careers in some of the best-known laboratories and research facilities, including Jodrell Bank and the National Nuclear Laboratory


Our expertise was recognised as far back as 1969 when we were one of the centres chosen to carry out tests on samples gathered from the Moon by Neil Armstrong’s historic Apollo 11 mission. Fast forward to the present day and we have internationally recognised experts, teaching a cutting edge curriculum and contributing to world class research.

Substantial discounts are available for International students.  
More information on fees can be found in the Money section of our website. 
Your tuition fees will cover most costs associated with your programme (including registration, tuition, supervision, assessment and examination).There are some extra costs that you might have to pay, or choose to pay, depending on your programme of study and the decisions you make. The list below has some examples, and any extra costs will vary.

Books (you’ll have access to books from your module reading lists in the library, but you may want to buy your own copies)
Optional field trips
Study abroad (including travel costs, accommodation, visas, immunisation)
Placement costs (including travel costs and accommodation)
Student visas (international students)
Laptop (you’ll have access to laptops and PC’s on campus, but you may want to buy your own)
Printing and photocopying
Professional-body membership
Graduation (gown hire and photography)

Remember, you’ll still need to take into account your living costs. This could include accommodation, travel and food – to name just a few.
