COURSE OVERVIEW

This is a place – and a university – with a fierce commitment to the performing arts.


That passion has always been part of our courses at Hull. You not only learn about the theatre; you learn through making theatre. Being a drama student here means being a member of a busy theatre community that performs, creates, communicates and engages with a variety of audiences.


Our pioneering programmes let you explore the theories behind performance, as well as giving you loads of opportunities to get to grips with practical performance projects. And our staff will always encourage you to pursue your interests.


So at Hull you can develop your talents in whichever area appeals to you – whether it’s as a performer, designer, creative technician, producer, writer or teacher. And you’ll experience a range of theatre-making opportunities on a weekly basis: from classical to experimental by way of digital, educational and participatory performance.


You could also benefit from our relationships with arts organisations including leading theatre companies Hull Truck, Middle Child and New Diorama. And we’ll continue to support your career even after you graduate, with events such as the annual Gulbenkian Careers and Employability Festival.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
