COURSE OVERVIEW

Hull has a remarkable literary legacy that has seen it called the country's "most poetic city". Poets Andrew Marvell and Philip Larkin lived here, while the University counts the likes of Douglas Dunn and Roger McGough among our alumni.


Literature affects how we think about and communicate with the world around us. It informs our understanding of ourselves and other cultures, past and present.


Explore literature from the medieval era to the 21st century. Our modules cover (among many other things) English and American poetry, children's literature, dystopian fiction, the literature of modernism and experimentation, drama from ancient Greek to contemporary British, Gothic, crime and transgression.


You'll gain the skills to analyse, research and communicate at a very high level - giving you the skills that are prized in many professions.


And you'll find plenty of opportunities to make your own mark - with an active, student-led English Society and the Hull Scribbler, a student-run annual anthology of writing. You'll also get the chance to participate in our termly Writing Showcases, which are organised by students and celebrate our students' work.
