courseName: MATHEMATICS-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

An intellectually challenging degree which encourages conceptual and abstract thought.


You’ll gain an understanding of pure and applied mathematics on this accredited course, while developing your knowledge of probability, statistics, and numerical programming.


You'll study in small groups as part of our close-knit mathematical community, under renowned researchers whose specialisms include algebra, geometry, fluid dynamics and astrophysics.


Under their expert guidance, you’ll work on projects that will push and develop your abilities in topics at the frontier of mathematics. Our degrees prepare you for your future career by encouraging conceptual and abstract thought.


Students with good A level results, or equivalent, may be eligible for the Gillian Stead Bursary - worth up to £6,300 over three years.

Additional Information about FEE
*The amount you pay may increase each year, in line with inflation - but capped to the Retail Price Index (RPI).
The fees shown are for 2022 entry. The fees for 2023 have not yet been confirmed and may increase.
UK students can take out a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of their course and a maintenance loan of up to £9,706 to cover living costs.
Substantial discounts are available for International students.  
More information on fees can be found in the Money section of our website. 
Your tuition fees will cover most costs associated with your programme (including registration, tuition, supervision, assessment and examination).There are some extra costs that you might have to pay, or choose to pay, depending on your programme of study and the decisions you make. The list below has some examples, and any extra costs will vary.

Books (you’ll have access to books from your module reading lists in the library, but you may want to buy your own copies)
Optional field trips
Study abroad (including travel costs, accommodation, visas, immunisation)
Placement costs (including travel costs and accommodation)
Student visas (international students)
Laptop (you’ll have access to laptops and PC’s on campus, but you may want to buy your own)
Printing and photocopying
Professional-body membership
Graduation (gown hire and photography)

Remember, you’ll still need to take into account your living costs. This could include accommodation, travel and food – to name just a few. 
ENTRY REQUIREMENT:
