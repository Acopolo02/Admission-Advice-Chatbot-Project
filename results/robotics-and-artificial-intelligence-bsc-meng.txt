courseName: ROBOTICS-AND-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-BSC-MENG
COURSE OVERVIEW

Robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming the way we live and work.


Driverless vehicles and pilotless drones are appearing on our roads and in our skies. Amazon’s automated warehouses are revolutionising the way businesses operate. Robots are being used instead of humans in hazardous areas. The world is ever-changing. And it needs skilled, hands-on people to keep it turning.


This multi-disciplinary course is a blend of both robotics and AI. You’ll get a solid background in computer science and programming, together with experience of the AI tools that are needed to give robots the ability to autonomously operate in the real world.


You’ll become an expert in Python, an industry-standard language used in many fields and especially in AI. From the very start, you’ll be working with real robots, learning how they work and how to program them. We don’t just focus on technology - you’ll also study the increasing impact of AI and robotics on everyone in society and the ethical dilemmas that come with such rapid and life-changing advances in technology. Throughout your studies, you’ll develop your professional skills and build a portfolio of work to show employers.


Here at Hull, we offer students the option of a guaranteed paid year in industry. This is a great opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills in the workplace, learn industry skills and make yourself more employable after you graduate. Foundation year students would need to transfer to a BSc or MEng programme to take this option.


Hull is ranked in the top 5 universities in the country for research impact*. Our teaching is linked to our research in simulation, visualisation, dependable systems, robotics, 3D printing and mobile and distributed computing - meaning you’ll be at the forefront of developments in this rapidly growing field.


We provide a range of specialist facilities, including a dedicated robotics lab. Here you’ll get hands-on with DJI Drones, Turtlebot3 mobile robots and humanoids like Baxter, Nao and Pepper. And you’ll be able to digitally fabricate 3D models, prototypes and parts for your robotic systems in our FabLab. In addition to our robotics hardware, we also have motion capture environments for drones and VR/AR and MR facilities in the Hull Immersive Visualisation Environment (HIVE).


There are also a number of active student-led societies and a host of extracurricular opportunities - from hackathons to networking events with employers to help you enjoy your time at university.
