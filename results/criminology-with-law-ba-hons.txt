courseName: CRIMINOLOGY-WITH-LAW-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Investigate the causes of crime and the responses to it. By combining criminology with the study of law, you’ll examine the connection between crime, the law and criminal justice.


Our links with criminal justice agencies give you incredible opportunities for relevant work placements and visits. You’ll explore how policing tries to maintain order and control crime.


You’ll consider the values of the criminal justice system in relation to issues like stop and search powers and detention time limits. And you’ll study how the media represents crime and punishment in films, games and music.


When you choose one of our Criminology degrees, you’ll get the chance to apply for a semester-long placement with Humberside Police**. You’ll work with areas like CSI, the Special Branch Ports Unit, community policing, cyber crime and the custody suite. And you’ll visit crime scenes, observe interviews and collect evidence.


It also means you'll get a range of amazing opportunities to explore criminology in real-life situations, such as through placements, field trips to courts, and police stations and prisons. Recent students have also had the opportunity to investigate policing and security issues.


Put what you learn into practice in our purpose-built replica crime scene facility right here on campus. A recent addition to the university, it provides detailed and realistic crime scenes for you to explore. Get hands on: collect evidence, explore criminal activity and see the world of forensic science brought to life.


You can also expand your skills and experience through a range of rewarding volunteering opportunities - such as the Appropriate Adult scheme, as well as via our vibrant Student Law Society.


Our well-established annual Careers in Criminal Justice event allows our students to hear from, and network with employers from the sector, and you will learn from lecturers who are experts in their own relevant areas – from modern-day slavery to knife crime; from domestic violence to cyber terrorism. They bring their specialist knowledge into the lecture theatre and help you define and develop your own areas of interest.
