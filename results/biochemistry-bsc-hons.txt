courseName: BIOCHEMISTRY-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Biochemistry is the chemistry behind the complexity of life. Here, you'll study the fundamentals of chemistry and biology so you can appreciate the fascinating interface between the two. Our researchers are recognised for their expertise, which feeds straight into your course.


You’ll be taught and inspired by biochemists, chemists and biologists. All leaders in their fields – from researchers in medical imaging, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, wound healing and cancer to experts in lab-on-a-chip miniaturised biochemistry.


Our industry-standard resources include mass spectrometry facilities, our own PET (Positron Emission Tomography) Research Centre, laser technology for elemental analysis and microfluidic fabrication capability.
