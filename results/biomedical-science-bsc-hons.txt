courseName: BIOMEDICAL-SCIENCE-BSC-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

A Biomedical Science degree from Hull opens doors to a career in laboratory science and beyond. 


Biomedical science applies biological principles to medicine. It explores the physiological processes and functions of the human body to appreciate disease processes, diagnosis and treatment.


This is a dynamic topic with continual advancements in health care and science driving innovation and research. Through supported lab learning, you'll gain a deep understanding of the human form and function in health and disease. We designed our Biomedical Science degree with input from the Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.


You'll gather the knowledge and skills for employment in a variety of settings – including potentially life-saving work at the cutting edge of health research.


This course is accredited by The Institute of Biomedical Science - so you can be confident that it's been approved by expert academics and professionals as meeting industry standards.
