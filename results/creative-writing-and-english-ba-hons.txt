courseName: CREATIVE-WRITING-AND-ENGLISH-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Hull has a long association with creative writing. The city was the home of poets Andrew Marvell and Philip Larkin, while the University counts Douglas Dunn and Roger McGough among its alumni.


This course allows you to focus on honing your craft through a mixture of practical workshops and seminar discussions. You'll develop your confidence in writing by developing core skills in characterisation, storytelling and creating a sense of place.


You'll also create and refine longer pieces of writing, experimenting in different genres and forms – including fantasy and science fiction, non-fiction, scriptwriting, short stories and poetry. As practitioners and published authors, our tutors bring their expertise and creativity into each session.


Our programmes provide a first-class grounding in literature from the medieval era to the 21st century, by way of English and American authors of poetry, short fiction, drama and novels. Our writing modules enable you to develop high-quality creative work including short stories, genre fiction, non-fiction, novels, poetry and scripts.


There's a lot to get involved in outside of the lecture theatre at Hull. You can get involved in extra-curricular activities including our active, student-led English Society and HU Writes.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
