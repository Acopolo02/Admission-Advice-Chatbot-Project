courseName: MUSIC-COMMUNITY-AND-EDUCATION-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Pursue your creative endeavours – whether that’s as a peripatetic music teacher, a classroom music specialist, an animateur, or an arts practitioner working with diverse communities.


To thrive in today’s fast-moving music culture, you’ll need a wide range of musical and technical skills, and to be able to work confidently with others across a range of professional contexts.


Your practical, applied work will culminate in a large-scale project that will be a stepping stone into your chosen career.


You'll study a range of technical skills to enable you to realise your best work. Core skills might include: curriculum design, project management, music theory and analysis, pedagogical theory, fluency with key pieces of music software, research skills, and festival programming.


You'll receive robust training in the critical and contextual dimensions of the study of music, working with expert staff to explore, interrogate and challenge received wisdom about the value, status and significance of music in our society.


BA Music (Community and Education) is a variant of the BA Music programme. This means that you will share the same modules as other BA Music students, although when there is optionality in each module, your assessments, and specialist cluster groups, will focus on Community and Education.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
