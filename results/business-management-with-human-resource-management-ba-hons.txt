COURSE OVERVIEW

The most important resource for any business is its people. So the human resource management (HRM) expertise you’ll gain here will be valued anywhere in the world. We’ll train you how to employ, engage and lead people – preparing for your own career in management. 


We focus on applying what you learn to real business situations – through projects, case studies and industry collaborations. In fact, you’ll work on projects with local companies right from your first year.


We’ve also got specialist HRM modules covering subjects like employee relations, learning and development, and the organisational context of HRM.
