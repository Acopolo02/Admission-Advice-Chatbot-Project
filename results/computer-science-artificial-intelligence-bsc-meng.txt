COURSE OVERVIEW

Sorry, this course is unavailable for study in 2022. You may be interested in BSc Computer Science, BSc Computer Science (Software Engineering) or  BSc Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, which are available for entry this year.


Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the way we live and work.


From self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, AI and machine learning systems are helping people make better decisions, improve safety and even reduce our carbon footprint. Techniques like deep learning and the integration of big data are increasingly giving computers the ability to operate and make sensible decisions in our messy, unstructured world.


Our AI-focussed programme will give you a solid grounding in computer science and equip you with the knowledge and skills you’ll need to be part of the AI future.


Learn advanced Python programming skills and develop your own software using industry standard techniques and tools. Learn about essential areas such as databases and networks, operating systems and the cloud. Gain specialist knowledge and experience in the development of intelligent systems, including machine learning, algorithms and complexity and visual computing.


And we don’t just focus on the technology - you’ll also study the increasing impact of AI on everyone in society.


Our degree is designed with your future career in mind. In your first year, you’ll take a module on professional development, while in your final year there is the chance to develop your own project, which you can show to employers when you apply for jobs.


There is also the option to spend a year in industry. We are now offering a guaranteed paid placement on all our Computer Science courses. Taken between the second and third years, this forms a recognised part of your degree. (Foundation year students would need to transfer to a BSc or MEng programme to take this option).


When you join us, you’ll get access to the latest industry-standard facilities,including high-performance workstations, gigabit networking, swarm and humanoid robots, VR headsets, a 3D immersive cube, motion capture, AR and MR. We are ranked sixth in the UK for learning resources in Computer Science. And it’s all here on our single-site campus for you to use.


Our courses are shaped by our world-leading research in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, intelligent and interactive systems, robotics, simulation, visualisation, and mobile and distributed computing.


When you are not studying there are plenty of extra-curricular activities for you to get involved in, such as student societies, hackathons and networking events with employers.
