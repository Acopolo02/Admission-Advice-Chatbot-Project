COURSE OVERVIEW

Education and learning in all its forms has the power to enable individuals, communities, institutions and society to change and transform.


The BA Education Studies is an innovative programme, which offers opportunities to tailor your degree towards a specific career interest should you wish. Alongside the central programme there are three optional pathways, Youth and Community Work (YCW), Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Special Educational Needs, Disability and Inclusion (SENDI) with the additional opportunity to create a bespoke programme from the available modules.


This critical study of educational processes, systems and approaches is situated within cultural, societal and political contexts. You will be engaged with learning spaces and places in and beyond formal educational settings, in an approach that will challenge your assumptions of what education is and where it takes place. Through engagement with real-world experiences and by examining contemporary issues, you will be equipped with the skills required to be agents of change in a complex and ever evolving educational landscape.


Make a difference to the lives of children, young people, adults and communities. Education is at the heart of creating more fair and equal societies. Tailor your degree through our new optional pathways and build your experience through work placements and project based learning:



Youth and Community Work (YCW)
Teaching English for Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)

moduleName Education, Power and Knowledge
moduleName Education is at the forefront of social change for social justice. This module offers you the opportunity to make a difference, through Education, from the beginning of your studies. As agents of educational change you will undertake a collaborative project which focuses on the issues you are passionate about, alongside fellow students and academics. You will examine how mainstream education has been shaped through agendas of Power. But this module then introduces you to existing alternate approaches to education, and to the direct action of educators and learners which come from those approaches. Alternate approaches to education can act as drivers of change to challenge poverty, inequality and sustainable community development at local, national and global contexts.
