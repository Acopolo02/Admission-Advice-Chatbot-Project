courseName: GRAPHIC-DESIGN-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

You'll learn about visual design, creative thinking, typography, the use of colour and composition and design history – and how to apply this knowledge through 2D and 3D design, web applications, animation and other evolving media. As well as a focus on your technical skills, you will also develop vital knowledge in leadership and professional practice – working as professionals do in a studio environment, while continually refining your own individual portfolio of work.


You’ll have exclusive access to our media labs, home to the latest digital media software and hardware used in the industry today.


In the Graphic Design, Art Direction and Creative Direction modules, you will learn how to create visual solutions for specific audiences for specific purposes. This is the very heart of graphic design — to first understand an audience, then present effective messages using text and imagery suitable for that audience.


Taught by lecturers with a diverse range of industry experience – including digital media and graphic design, advertising, game design and web development – you will concentrate on constructing conceptual graphic design solutions that stimulate desired responses. Only then are your ideas practically applied using hardware and software. The ability to first conceptualise (and also implement) graphic design solutions are valuable skills, and this degree programme is designed to give our graduates an advantage over those with only technical abilities.


Creativity lives and breathes at the University of Hull. Always has done, always will. It’s central to what universities do. But at Hull, we’re building something that goes far beyond our four walls.
