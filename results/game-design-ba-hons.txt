courseModules 
First Year
moduleName Game Design & Prototyping
moduleName Game Design & Prototyping
moduleName You probably have a number of ideas for games you’d like to make. It’s time you started making them. You will develop your own game concepts by applying game design theories and principles and bring your ideas to life by learning to prototype them within a game engine. This module will build on your scripting skills from the ground up through small simple game prototypes, providing you with the skills to create your first finished game project.

moduleName Art & Animation Fundamentals
moduleName Art & Animation Fundamentals
moduleName Any game you work on is going to need artwork. This module will teach you the fundamentals of visual design in order to make suitable and compelling artwork for your games. You’ll explore traditional and digital art techniques and apply artistic concepts such as composition, line and shape, colour theory, texture, typography etc. This module will allow you to develop an ongoing digital sketchbook as you experiment with line drawing, perspective drawing, thumbnail sketching, silhouettes, character concepts, environment concepts, graphic design as well as digital tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and 3D art packages.

moduleName Level Design
moduleName Level Design
moduleName Excessive guidance markers, compasses and mini maps can often feel contrived in video games. A well designed level should be able to guide the player using the landscape and the game environment. Find out how you can do this in your own games as we explore principles and theories of level design and put them into practice by making a 3D version of an imagined game world. In this module you will look at generating suitable level designs and prototyping them in a level blockout. We will explore building 3D environments using geometry and terrain and adding interaction through scripting game logic to enhance the players journey.
