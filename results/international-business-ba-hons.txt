courseName: INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

We've partnered with one of Europe’s leading business schools, ESSEC in France, to create a unique opportunity within this degree that helps to develop the next generation of international business leaders.


On this degree, we'll challenge you to step outside your comfort zone and help you develop the skills to consistently make good business decisions.


You’ll learn about the different aspects of global business, with modules on the world economy, European business and emerging markets. Today’s managers must deal with different national business practices, cultural changes and language needs. They also need to appreciate how business functions like finance, marketing, human resource management or logistics work across national borders.


Make connections with professional industry networks, like-minded entrepreneurs, and corporate partners in our recently enhanced Business Lounge. And you'll have access to the Business School's industry-standard facilities like the Bloomberg and Executive Education suites. Or you could help SMEs with their challenges via our Business Clinic. 


A major benefit of this course is spending a semester at ESSEC, which is ranked in the world’s top 1% of business schools, learning from world-leading academics in some of Europe’s top industries. This will give you some of the valuable skills and experiences that employers actively look for.


This degree offers real world experience, with our Authentic Business Learning approach which means from day one, you’ll get to test your skills out through live business projects, placements, internships, and more.


You’ll start with a common first year to equip you with a broad base of business knowledge, which also allows you to switch degrees in your second year if you decide to change direction.


All Hull University Business School degrees have international accreditation from AACSB, which is held by fewer than 5% of business programmes worldwide. We’ll prepare you for the challenge of staying up to date in the unpredictable, dynamic business world. And we’ll guide your development into a confident, competitive business professional who can take on diverse roles in any organisation or sector.


It’s our way of putting you – and your career – at the heart of what we do.
