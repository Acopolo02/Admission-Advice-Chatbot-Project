courseName: BUSINESS-MANAGEMENT-WITH-ENTREPRENEURSHIP-BA-HONS
COURSE OVERVIEW

Launching and running a business requires specialist skills, expert knowledge and smart methods. We can help you develop them. And we can support you toward business success – either as an individual or as a member of an organisation. 


You’ll learn how organisations function as a whole, studying the areas that an entrepreneur needs to understand. So you’ll cover topics like accounting, marketing, HR, supply chain, business ethics, e-commerce and organisational management.


You’ll discover what factors can make or break entrepreneurs. And you’ll get hands on with a local SME via our Business Clinic, assisting them with a genuine problem or opportunity. 


Plus, you’ll have even more opportunities than ever before to make connections that will help you in your future career, from our many links with industry, as well as meeting with like-minded entrepreneurs, organisations and corporate partners in our recently enhanced Business Lounge. And you'll have access to the Business School's industry-standard facilities like the Bloomberg and Executive Education suites.
