The University of Hull’s Master of Laws in International Law (Conflict, Security and Human Rights) (LLM) degree programme presents a total study of International Law as an academic and vocational discipline. This LLM allows you not only to understand the public (political), private (economic) and moral (human rights) interactions of international law in a theoretical and practical sense, but also to specialise in the legal study of conflict, security and human rights.
This LLM is designed for students with a background in law, politics, international relations, social sciences, history and human geography. However, applicants are welcomed from all academic disciplines and career paths, including professional and aspiring lawyers, public officials, human rights activists, diplomats, journalists and others who are interested in understanding public international law and its role in responding to conflict, security and human rights challenges.
What you'll study
This LLM specifically provides the opportunity for in-depth study of the international legal response to some of the most serious perils facing humankind today.  The core focus is on problems of increasing warfare and armed conflict and their implications for human rights. Since these problems, in turn, are often fuelled by ‘natural’ problems, the focus is expanded to include these where appropriate.
This LLM examines the legal response to, amongst other topics, the global refugee crisis, the spread of terrorism, the proliferation of mass violence and internal armed conflict, piracy, and human trafficking, as well as natural disasters, health pandemics and economic crises. Even in societies relatively free from conflict, a preoccupation with security and the politics of fear are leading to an erosion of human rights protection and indeed to challenges to the very idea of human rights. Accordingly, this LLM explores legal responses to the challenge of preserving human rights in a world increasingly dominated by security concerns.
Taught by experts at the forefront of international law scholarship, this LLM provides students with a thorough knowledge and understanding of the legal regimes that have been developed to protect human rights (including Islamic and African Human Rights protection). Topics include international humanitarian law; the law regulating armed conflict both between and within sovereign states and involving state and non-state actors; legal regimes developed to create maritime security; international criminal justice and the role of law in uncovering truth and promoting reconciliation in the aftermath of violent conflict.
